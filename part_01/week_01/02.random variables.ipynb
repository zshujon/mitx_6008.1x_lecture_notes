This results in the bottom right table.\n",

    "## Random Variables Notation and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we denote random variables with capital/uppercase letters, such as $X$, $W$, $I$, etc. We use the phrases “probability table\", “probability mass function\" (abbreviated as PMF), and “probability distribution\" (often simply called a distribution) to mean the same thing, and in particular we denote the probability table for $X$ to be $\\mathcal{p}_X$ or $\\mathcal{p}_X(.)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write $\\mathcal{p}_X(x)$ to denote the entry of the probability table that has label $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ where $\\mathcal{X}$ is the set of values that random variable $X$ takes on. Note that we use lowercase letters like $x$ to denote variables storing nonrandom values. We can also look up values in a probability table using specific outcomes, e.g., from earlier, we have $\\mathcal{p}_W(rainy) = 1/6$ and $\\mathcal{p}_I(1) = 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use the same notation as in math where a function $f$ might also be written as $f(.)$ to explicitly indicate that it is the function of one variable. Both $f$ and $f(.)$ refer to a function whereas $f(x)$ refers to the value of the function $f$ evaluated at the point $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how to use all this notation, recall that a probability table consists of nonnegative entries that add up to 1. In fact, each of the entries is at most 1 (otherwise the numbers would add to more than 1). For a random variable $X$ taking on values in $\\mathcal{X}$, we can write out these constraints as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 \\leq \\mathcal{p}_X(x) \\leq 1 \\ for \\ all \\ x \\in \\mathcal{X},\\ \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\mathcal{p}_X(x) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Often in the course, if we are making statements about all possible outcomes of $X$, we will omit writing out the alphabet $\\mathcal{X}$ explicitly. For example, instead of the above, we might write the following equivalent statement: $$0 \\leq \\mathcal{p}_X(x) \\leq 1 \\ for \\ all \\ x,\\ \\sum_{x} \\mathcal{p}_X(x) = 1$$\n",
