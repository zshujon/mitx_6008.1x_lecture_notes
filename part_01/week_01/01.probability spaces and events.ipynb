    "\n",
    "- The sample space is always specified to be collectively exhaustive, meaning that every possible outcome is in it, and mutually exclusive, meaning that once the experiment is run (e.g., flipping the fair coin), exactly one possible outcome in the sample space happens. It's impossible for multiple outcomes in the sample space to simultaneously happen! It's also impossible for none of the outcomes to happen!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probabilities can be thought of as fractions of times outcomes occur; thus, probabilities are nonnegative and at least 0 and at most 1.\n",

    "- If we add up the probabilities of all the possible outcomes in the sample space, we get 1.\n",
    "(For the fair coin flip, $\\mathbb{P}(heads) + \\mathbb{P}(tails) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some intuition for this: Consider the coin flipping experiment. What does the fraction of times heads occur and the fraction of times tails occur add up to? Since these are the only two possible outcomes (and again, recall that these outcomes are exclusive in that they can't simultaneously occur, and exhaustive since they are the only possible outcomes), these two fractions will always sum to 1. For a massive number of repeats of the experiment, these two fractions correspond to $\\mathbb{P}(heads)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(tails)$; the fractions sum to 1 and so these probabilities also sum to 1."

    "At this point, we've actually already seen the most basic data structure used throughout this course for modeling uncertainty, called a finite probability space (in this course, we'll often also just call this either a probability space or a probability model):\n",
    "\n",
    "A finite probability space consists of two ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a sample space $\\Omega$ consisting of a finite (i.e., not infinite) number of collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- an assignment of probabilities: for each possible outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, we assign a probability $\\mathbb{P}(outcome \\ \\omega)$ at least 0 and at most 1, where we require that the probabilities across all the possible outcomes in the sample space add up to 1: $$\\sum_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} \\mathbb{P}(outcome \\ \\omega) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "__Notation__: As shorthand we occasionally use the tuple “($\\Omega, \\mathbb{P}$)\" to refer to a finite probability space to remind ourselves of the two ingredients needed, sample space $\\Omega$ and an assignment of probabilities $\\mathbb{P}$. As we already saw, in code these two pieces can be represented together in a single Python dictionary. However, when we want to reason about probability spaces in terms of the mathematics, it's helpful to have names for the two pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why finite__? Of the two pieces making up a finite probability space ($\\Omega, \\mathbb{P}$), the sample space $\\Omega$ being finite is a fairly natural constraint, corresponding to how we typically work with Python dictionaries where there is only a finite number of keys. As we'll see, finite probability spaces are already extremely useful in practice. Pedagogically, finite probability spaces also provide a great intro to probability theory as they already carry a wealth of intuition, much of which carries over to a more complete story of general probability spaces!"

    "## Addendum: More on Sample Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, we saw that a sample space encoding the outcomes of 2 coin flips encodes all the information for 1 coin flip as well. Thus, we could use the same sample space to model a single coin flip. However, if we really only cared about a single coin flip, then a sample space encoding 2 coin flips is richer than we actually need it to be!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we model some uncertain situation, how we specify a sample space is not unique. We saw an example of this already in an earlier exercise where for rolling a single six-sided die, we can choose to name the outcomes differently, saying for instance \"roll 1\" instead of \"1\". We could even add a bunch of extraneous outcomes that all have probability 0. We could add extraneous information that doesn't matter such as \"Alice rolls 1\", \"Bob rolls 1\", etc where we enumerate out all the people who could roll the die in which the outcome is a 1. Sure, depending on the problem we are trying to solve, maybe knowing who rolled the die is important, but if we don't care about who rolled the die, then the information isn't helpful but it's still possible to include this information in the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking it's best to choose a sample space that is as simple as possible for modeling what we care about solving. For example, if we were rolling a six-sided die, and we actually only care about whether the face shows up at least 4 or not, then it's sufficient to just keep track of two outcomes, \"at least 4\" and \"less than 4\"."
